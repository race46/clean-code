# CLEAN CODE
We will be covering a lot of code. By the time we are done, we're going to know a lot about code and we'll be able to tell the difference between good code and bad code. And we'll know how to transform bad code into good code :)

## There Will Be Code
One might argue that soon all code will be generated instead of written and programmers won't be needed anymore! <b>NONESENSE</b>

## Bad Code

Why did a company which has a killer go out of business? 

_They had rushed the product to market and had made a huge mess in the code. As they added more and more features, the code got worse and worse until they simply could not manage it any longer._ 

<b>It was the bad code that brought the company down.</b>

We could say that we'd go back and clean it up later. Of course, but LeBlanc's law: _"Later equals never"_.

## The Total Cost of Owning a Mess
As the mess builds, the productivity of the team continues to decrease, asymptotically approaching zero.

The only way to make the deadline is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

Eventually the team rebels and they inform their manager about not to continue this project.
